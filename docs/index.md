# Welcome to My Go Study Note

This repository is a collection of my notes and examples while learning Go & its ecosystem. It covers various topics, including configuration, logging, messaging, orm, etc.  I have several workspaces, each with its own one topic like configuration.  Within each workspace, I have several modules, each with its own one example.  The examples are designed to be simple and easy to understand, focusing on the core concepts of each topic. The code is written in a modular way, allowing you to run each example independently.
