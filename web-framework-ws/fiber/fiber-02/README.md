# Fiber 02 Example
This example inherits every feature from fiber-02 example.  It has a circuit breaker middleware to handle service failures gracefully.

## Features
- Middleware
  - Accepts JSON 
  - Health Check
  - Monitor
  - Prometheus
  - Recovery
  - RequestID
  
## Endpoints
- `GET /api/gof/health`: Health check endpoint
- `GET /api/gof/metrics`: Prometheus metrics endpoint
- `GET /api/gof/monitor`: Monitor Page
- `GET /api/gof/info`: Application information endpoint
- `GET /api/gof/v1/authors/:id`: Get author by ID
- `GET /api/gof/v1/authors/names/:name`: Get author by name
- `GET /api/gof/v1/authors/?name=:name`: Get author by name with query parameter

## Load Testing
- Using Grafana k6 for load testing.

## [Circuit Breaker](https://docs.gofiber.io/contrib/circuitbreaker/)

### How It Works
1. Closed State:
   - Requests are allowed to pass normally.
   - Failures are counted.
   - If failures exceed a defined threshold, the circuit switches to Open state.

2. Open State:
   - Requests are blocked immediately to prevent overload.
   - The circuit stays open for a timeout period before moving to Half-Open.

3. Half-Open State:
   - Allows a limited number of requests to test service recovery.
   - If requests succeed, the circuit resets to Closed.
   - If requests fail, the circuit returns to Open.

### Circuit Breaker Benefits
* Prevents cascading failures in microservices.
* Improves system reliability by avoiding repeated failed requests.
* Reduces load on struggling services and allows recovery.

Install:
```bash
go get -u github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2
go get -u github.com/gofiber/contrib/circuitbreaker
```
Signature:
```go
circuitbreaker.New(config ...circuitbreaker.Config) *circuitbreaker.Middleware 
```

There are several configuration options available, such as:
1. Apply circuit breaker to all routes
2. Route and Route-Group specific circuit breaker
3. Circuit Breaker with custom failure handling
4. Circuit Breaker for External API calls or Outbound HTTP requests
5. Circuit Breaker with Concurrent Requests Handling
6. Circuit Breaker with Custom Metrics
7. Advanced: Multiple Circuit Breakers fo r Different Services

I recommend reading the [official documentation](https://docs.gofiber.io/contrib/circuitbreaker/) for more details and examples. In this example, I have implemented a basic circuit breaker that applies to all routes.
