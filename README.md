# Golang Study
This repository is a collection of my notes and examples while learning Go & its ecosystem. It covers various topics, including viper configuration, logging, messaging, orm, etc.
The examples are designed to be simple and easy to understand, focusing on the core concepts of each topic. The code is written in a modular way, allowing you to run each example independently.

Note: In all examples, I'l use **zerolog** for logging because it is simple as fmt.Println but more powerful.
